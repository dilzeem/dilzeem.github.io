      <description>I first came across Vim while I while I was in my bachelor studying Electrical Engineering. We had to do a few Computer Science classes where we learned how to program. In addition we were all forced to use UNIX, the vi editor, along with subversion. All this stuff was completely new to me. I was meant to be studying electrical engineering, why am I using a terminal, how am I supposed to type my C code and finish the homework assignments, how do I even exit this.</description>
