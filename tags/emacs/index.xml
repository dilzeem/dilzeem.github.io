      <description>This is just outline how I set up this org mode for my blogging. I use Emacs, Org mode and Hugo. Using Org-Mode I find helps in structuring your thoughts and is a powerful tool that has a lot of capabilities.
To set up something similar I recommend following along this blog as it has pretty good instructions on how to set up this blog. My own setup is essentially similar with small variations.</description>

      <description>I first came across Vim while I while I was in my bachelor studying Electrical Engineering. We had to do a few Computer Science classes where we learned how to program. In addition we were all forced to use UNIX, the vi editor, along with subversion. All this stuff was completely new to me. I was meant to be studying electrical engineering, why am I using a terminal, how am I supposed to type my C code and finish the homework assignments, how do I even exit this.</description>
