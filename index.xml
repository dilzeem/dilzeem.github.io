      <description>I first came across Vim while I while I was in my bachelor studying Electrical Engineering. We had to do a few Computer Science classes where we learned how to program. In addition we were all forced to use UNIX, the vi editor, along with subversion. All this stuff was completely new to me. I was meant to be studying electrical engineering, why am I using a terminal, how am I supposed to type my C code and finish the homework assignments, how do I even exit this.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like notebooks. That was the title of the youtube video the algorithims had suggest me to watch. How could one not like using Jupyter Notebooks? This was how I learnt to program in python and how I worked through an online deep learning course (fast.ai). What was even more interesting, was that what sparked the speakers to present the talk was from a twitter fued with the primary teacher of fast.</description>

      <title>Kaggle me a Data Scientist</title>

      <description>I feel like calling oneself a data scientist bring upon notions of someone with a Ph.D. in machine learning or statistics who has spent years honing his craft. This is not me, but in the last week, I have learned enough to be in the top 4% of a data science competition on Kaggle which has a prize pool of $1,200,000 USD.
My journey started with upskilling myself while I search for work in Europe.</description>
